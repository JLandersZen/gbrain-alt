# Execution Plan: Taxonomy Replacement + Notion Import POC

**Spec:** [SPECIFICATION.md](SPECIFICATION.md)
**Branch:** `internal-adaptation`
**Date:** 2026-04-16
**Method:** Vertical slices. Each sub-slice produces passing tests, a commit, and
a push. No sub-slice leaves the codebase broken.

---

## Phases and Workspaces

| Phase | Where | What |
|-------|-------|------|
| **Phase 1** | This repo (`gbrain-alt`), branch `internal-adaptation` | Taxonomy replacement in tool code, tests, docs |
| **Phase 2** | New worktree alongside `ralph-pva` (same parent folder) | Notion export → brain repo via existing `gbrain` migrate skill |

Phase 1 changes the tool. Phase 2 uses the tool — no new Notion-specific code in
gbrain-alt. The user exports from Notion via the Notion UI, then we run the
migrate skill against the exported markdown+CSV to see how well gbrain handles it
as-is. Gaps found during Phase 2 feed back into gbrain-alt as targeted fixes on
`internal-adaptation`, not as new subsystems.

---

## Phase 1: Taxonomy Replacement

Replace Garry Tan's 9 hardcoded types with the PARA+GTD taxonomy throughout
gbrain-alt. Three sub-slices, each independently committable.

### Slice 1a — Core Code + Direct Unit Tests ✅ DONE

**Completed:** 2026-04-16. All 591 tests pass. Beads: `gbrain-alt-bxp`.

**Goal:** The TypeScript type system and runtime behavior use the new taxonomy.
`bun test` passes.

**Files changed:**

| File | Change | Lines |
|------|--------|-------|
| `src/core/types.ts:2` | Replace `PageType` union with 9 new types | ~3 |
| `src/core/markdown.ts:125-139` | Rewrite `inferType()` — new directory map, default `resource` | ~15 |
| `src/commands/backlinks.ts:31,37` | Update `extractEntityRefs` regex to include all 9 entity directories | ~5 |
| `test/markdown.test.ts` | Update `inferType()` test cases for new directories/types | ~30 |
| `test/backlinks.test.ts` | Update entity directory pattern assertions | ~10 |

**Acceptance:**
- `bun test -- test/markdown.test.ts test/backlinks.test.ts` passes
- `inferType('contexts/at-work.md')` returns `'context'`
- `inferType('organizations/acme.md')` returns `'organization'`
- `inferType('unknown/foo.md')` returns `'resource'` (new default)
- `extractEntityRefs` detects links to all 9 entity directories

**Commit message pattern:** `feat: replace PageType union with PARA+GTD taxonomy`

---

### Slice 1b — Remaining Tests + Benchmark ✅ DONE

**Completed:** 2026-04-16. All 591 tests pass. Beads: `gbrain-alt-2in`.

**Goal:** All test files use the new types. Full `bun test` passes. Search quality
benchmark runs with new entity types.

**Files with old type references** (found via grep post-1a):

| File | Old types found |
|------|-----------------|
| `test/pglite-engine.test.ts` | `person`, `company`, `concept` in fixtures/assertions |
| `test/dedup.test.ts` | `person`, `concept` in SearchResult fixtures |
| `test/search.test.ts` | type values in search result fixtures |
| `test/search-limit.test.ts` | type values in limit test fixtures |
| `test/utils.test.ts` | type values in utility test fixtures |
| `test/file-resolver.test.ts` | type values in resolver fixtures |
| `test/e2e/mechanical.test.ts` | type filtering, assertions, CRUD test types |
| `test/e2e/search-quality.test.ts` | type values in search quality fixtures |
| `test/benchmark-search-quality.ts` | 40+ page definitions — types, slugs, directory prefixes |

**Additional files changed** (discovered during implementation):

| File | Old types found |
|------|-----------------|
| `test/import-file.test.ts` | `concept` types and `concepts/` slug paths in import test fixtures |
| `test/publish.test.ts` | `companies/` directory reference in test content |
| `test/e2e/sync.test.ts` | `concept` types and `concepts/` directory in sync test repo setup |
| `test/e2e/fixtures/` | Renamed directories: `companies/`→`organizations/`, `concepts/`→`resources/`, `deals/`→`events/`, `sources/` merged into `resources/`. Updated all frontmatter `type:` values. |

**Acceptance:**
- `bun test` passes (all unit + inline E2E test files) ✅
- `bun run test/benchmark-search-quality.ts` completes without type errors ✅
- No references to `deal`, `yc`, `civic`, `concept`, `source`, or `media` as
  literal type values in any test file (excluding comments about the migration) ✅

**Commit message pattern:** `test: update all test fixtures to PARA+GTD types`

---

### Slice 1c — Documentation ✅ DONE

**Completed:** 2026-04-16. All 591 tests pass. Beads: `gbrain-alt-0lf`.

**Goal:** All documentation references the new taxonomy. No Garry Tan-specific
type references remain outside of CHANGELOG.md historical entries.

**Files changed:**

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `docs/GBRAIN_RECOMMENDED_SCHEMA.md` | Full rewrite: directory structure, decision tree, page templates, disambiguation rules, worked examples, architecture diagrams — all updated to PARA+GTD taxonomy. Non-taxonomy content preserved. |
| `skills/_brain-filing-rules.md` | Decision protocol, misfiling patterns, notability gate, iron law — all updated to new types |
| `README.md` | 11 edits: type list, code examples, schema table, narrative references |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Audited — no old type references found, no changes needed |
| `skills/enrich/SKILL.md` | 8 edits: company→organization in templates and references |
| `skills/query/SKILL.md` | concepts/ → resources/ in citation example |
| `skills/publish/SKILL.md` | 7 occurrences of companies/acme → organizations/acme |
| `skills/setup/SKILL.md` | Updated entity type lists |
| `skills/ingest/SKILL.md` | Updated all directory references |
| `skills/maintain/SKILL.md` | Updated directory references |
| `skills/briefing/SKILL.md` | deal→project throughout |
| `skills/migrations/v0.9.0.md` | companies/ → organizations/ |
| `skills/migrations/v0.8.1.md` | Updated directory references |
| `docs/GBRAIN_V0.md` | concepts/ → resources/, type: concept → type: resource |
| `docs/designs/HOMEBREW_FOR_PERSONAL_AI.md` | deal-tracker → project-tracker |
| `docs/guides/originals-folder.md` | concepts/ → resources/ |
| `docs/guides/entity-detection.md` | companies/ → organizations/, concepts/ → resources/ |
| `docs/guides/diligence-ingestion.md` | companies/ → organizations/ |
| `docs/guides/repo-architecture.md` | Full directory tree rewrite to PARA+GTD |
| `docs/guides/skill-development.md` | media/ → resources/ |
| `docs/guides/idea-capture.md` | concepts/ → resources/, media/ → resources/ |
| `docs/guides/content-media.md` | media/ → resources/, sources/ → resources/ |
| `docs/guides/cron-schedule.md` | deal → project |
| `docs/guides/brain-agent-loop.md` | deal → project |
| `docs/guides/enrichment-pipeline.md` | deal → project, company → organization |

**Acceptance:** ✅
- `grep -rn` for old type names finds zero hits outside CHANGELOG.md ✅
- Documentation decision tree matches spec §2.10 ✅
- README examples use `resources/` not `concepts/` ✅

**Commit message pattern:** `docs: update all documentation to PARA+GTD taxonomy`

---

### Slice 1 — E2E Validation ✅ DONE

**Completed:** 2026-04-16. All 95 E2E tests + 591 unit tests pass. Beads: `gbrain-alt-x63`.

Ran full E2E test lifecycle using podman (pgvector/pgvector:pg16 container on
port 5434). Found one count assertion bug: `test/e2e/mechanical.test.ts` expected
5 resources but the `crustdata-sarah-chen.md` fixture was migrated from `type: source`
to `type: resource` in Slice 1b, making the correct count 6. Fixed and verified.

---

## Phase 2: Notion Import POC

**Workspace:** `ralph-brain` worktree at `/Users/jlanders/gitlab_local/ralph-brain`
(created via `bd worktree create` from `ralph-pva`). Notion export goes in
`ralph-brain/exports/`. Imported brain pages go in `ralph-brain/brain/`.

### Slice 2a — Local-first Config ⬅ NEXT (blocker for Slice 2b)

**Beads:** `gbrain-alt-j53` (P1, open)

**Problem:** gbrain config (`~/.gbrain/config.json`) and PGLite database
(`~/.gbrain/brain.pglite`) are global singletons. No per-project isolation.
Worktrees, experimentation, and multiple brains all collide. Blowing away a
POC worktree doesn't reset the database.

**Fix:** Look for `.gbrain/config.json` in the current directory (walking up
to repo root) first, fall back to `~/.gbrain/`. When found locally,
`database_path` defaults to `.gbrain/brain.pglite` relative to that config.
`gbrain init` should create `.gbrain/` in the current project by default,
with a `--global` flag for the old behavior.

**Files to change:**
- `src/core/config.ts` — `loadConfig()` and `saveConfig()`: walk up from cwd
  looking for `.gbrain/config.json`, fall back to `~/.gbrain/`
- `src/commands/init.ts` — default `dbPath` to project-local `.gbrain/brain.pglite`
  instead of `~/.gbrain/brain.pglite`. Add `--global` flag for old behavior.
- Tests: `test/config.test.ts` — test local-first discovery

**Acceptance:**
- `gbrain init` in a project creates `.gbrain/config.json` and `.gbrain/brain.pglite`
  in the project directory
- `gbrain init --global` creates at `~/.gbrain/` (old behavior)
- `gbrain doctor`, `gbrain import`, etc. find local config automatically
- Two worktrees can each have independent databases
- `bun test` passes

### Slice 2b — Notion Import (second attempt)

**Depends on:** Slice 2a (local-first config)

**Goal:** Same as original Slice 2 but with fixes from first POC attempt.

**What changed since first attempt:**
- Migrate skill updated with prerequisites section (checks init, API keys,
  permanent output dir), Notion-specific fixes (truncated titles, slug collision
  investigation), and post-migration AGENTS.md update
- ralph-brain worktree recreated fresh via `bd worktree create`
- gbrain skills installed in `ralph-brain/.claude/skills/gbrain-*/`
- User needs to re-download Notion export (old one was in deleted worktree)

**Steps:**
1. Fix local-first config (Slice 2a) so `gbrain init` creates per-project DB
2. In ralph-brain: `gbrain init` (creates `.gbrain/` locally)
3. Set up `.env` with `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_BASE_URL` (company AI gateway)
4. Download fresh Notion export into `ralph-brain/exports/`
5. Run migrate skill — it now checks prerequisites, handles truncated titles,
   investigates slug collisions, and outputs to `brain/` (permanent)
6. `gbrain import brain/ --no-embed` then verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set
   before running `gbrain embed --stale`
7. Validate: `gbrain search`, `gbrain list -n 999`, spot-check pages

**First POC findings (2026-04-16) to watch for:**
- Notion export truncates long titles → relations don't resolve (migrate skill
  now warns about this)
- Don't create entity subdirs in advance (import creates them)
- Check `OPENAI_API_KEY` before starting embeddings
- PGLite is single-writer — don't run concurrent gbrain commands
- `gbrain list` caps at 50 — may need a tool fix if `-n` flag is still broken

**Acceptance:**
- `gbrain --version` works in `ralph-brain`
- `gbrain doctor` passes with project-local database
- Notion pages import with correct types via `inferType()`
- Properties map to frontmatter, relations map to links
- `gbrain search` returns meaningful results
- `gbrain graph` traverses relationships
- AGENTS.md updated to reflect gbrain as SoR

**What comes back to gbrain-alt:** Tool-level gaps discovered during import
get fixed on `internal-adaptation` as targeted slices.

## Risk Register

| Risk | Status | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Old type references in files not covered by audit | ✅ Resolved | Post-Slice-1c grep sweep found zero hits. |
| Benchmark search quality regresses with new types | ✅ Resolved | Benchmark ran clean. Search is type-agnostic. |
| Notion export truncates long page titles | **Active** | Migrate skill updated to warn. Agent should match on full title from page content, not filename. |
| Slug collisions from duplicate Notion pages | **Active** | Migrate skill updated to investigate before appending `-2`. |
| PGLite single-writer lock contention | **Active** | Don't run concurrent gbrain commands. Future: add warning or queue. |
| `gbrain list` caps at 50, `-n` flag ignored | **Active** | Needs tool fix in gbrain-alt. Not yet filed as separate issue. |
| Global config/DB prevents per-project isolation | **Active** | Blocked by `gbrain-alt-j53`. Fix is local-first config (Slice 2a). |
